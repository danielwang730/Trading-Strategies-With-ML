    "# Data Loading and Initial Feature Engineering for LSTM Model\n",
    "I will start by getting the day data and minute data in. Both of these sets of data were obtained from FRD, and both were cleaned in a separate notebook. The day data was created directly from the 1-min data, so the numbers should match perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few caveats about the data loading:\n",
    "1. I might only choose certain tickers, perhaps starting with the top 1,000 with the highest prices (or by market cap). To do that, I'll need to obtain a list of tickers with their market caps, that also matches the data that I have.\n",
    "2. I will need to obtain a list of stocks with their respective sectors. Specifically, I want to reduce the number of stocks in the \"Other\" category as much as possible, and I want each of them to be well-defined.\n",
    "   - There is the notion of trying to use the correlation between stocks (like I did with the MIDS 205 course) as potentially another predictive feature, but that's currently beyond the scope of what I'm trying to do here.\n",
    "   - I will, however, try the embeddings strategy and see if they can learn anything about each other.\n",
    "   - One more thing is that I could also try learning embeddings **from the tickers themselves** rather than just their sectors. That might actually provide even more support for certain tickers moving together, rather than just the correlation like I was using previously.\n",
    "     - *This might only be possible/feasible when I learn about transformers, so perhaps not yet*\n",
    "3. For every day for my chosen tickers, I will only fetch data from 8:00am to 9:35am, primarily because I believe the 1.5 PM hours before the market opens will be the most helpful in defining what will happen to the stock. If I'm starting with trying to predict the Close price of a stock from its Open price, I will likely only use data up to and including 9:28am as my training data.\n",
    "   - The reason I'm thinking of also fetching the first 5 minutes of the Open is because those initial trading minutes are the most volatile and often the most deterministic of how a stock might perform. While I won't be using those minutes if I'm trying to predict the Close, I might want to test opening-range breakout strategies later on. If so, I might try to do some shorter-term predictions, perhaps seeing if I ever hit a certain R-level within XX minutes of entering at the 5-minute mark (or 15-min, 30-min, etc.)"

As of now, there are still some tickers listed as \"Other\" or \"Shell Companies\", neither of which is defined under the GICS 11 overarching sectors.
